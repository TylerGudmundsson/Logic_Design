Quartus Designs


In order to view these projects and simulations you will need Quartus 9.0 or higher.  

If unfamiliar with with quartus, first open the project file 'fileName.qpf'. 

To see the circuit layout open 'filename.bdf' and to view a sample out put open 'filename.vwf'.

These projects can be uploaded to the Altera UP2 educational board for real time evaluations.
